Observations:
- Majority of passengers did not survive.
- Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- Passengers in 1st class had a higher survival chance.
- Higher fares were associated with higher chances of survival.
- There are missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns.
- Fare distribution is right-skewed with some very high values (outliers).
- Age distribution is fairly normal but with missing data.
- Strong negative correlation between Pclass and Fare.

Summary:
Overall, survival is influenced by sex, passenger class, and fare. Females, higher class passengers, and those who paid higher fares had better chances of survival.
